# AI Navigator Browser Extension - User Manual

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the AI Navigator Browser Extension! This companion tool, also known as the "Clipper," makes it incredibly easy to save web pages directly into your AI Navigator knowledge base with a single click.

It eliminates the need to copy and paste URLs, streamlining your research and resource collection workflow.

## 2. Installation Guide

The extension is designed for Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and others.

**Follow these steps to install the extension:**

1.  **Open the Extensions Page:**
    *   In your browser, navigate to the extensions management page. You can usually do this by typing `chrome://extensions` (for Chrome) or `edge://extensions` (for Edge) into your address bar and pressing Enter.

2.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    *   Look for a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" on the extensions page (usually in the top-right corner) and make sure it is turned **ON**.

3.  **Load the Extension:**
    *   Once Developer Mode is enabled, you will see new buttons appear. Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button.

4.  **Select the Project Folder:**
    *   A file selection dialog will open. Navigate to and select the root folder of the `ai-resource-navigator` project (the folder that contains files like `manifest.json` and `index.html`). Click "Select Folder".

5.  **Installation Complete!**
    *   The "AI Navigator Clipper" extension will now appear in your list of extensions. You should also see its icon in your browser's toolbar. You may need to click the "Extensions" puzzle icon and "pin" the AI Navigator Clipper to make it permanently visible.

## 3. How to Use

Using the clipper is simple:

1.  **Find a Resource:** Browse the web and navigate to any article, blog post, or website you wish to save.

2.  **Click the Icon:** Click the **AI Navigator Clipper icon** in your browser's toolbar.

3.  **Save in AI Navigator:**
    *   A new browser tab will instantly open, loading your AI Navigator application.
    *   The "Add New Resource" dialog will automatically pop up.
    *   The URL of the page you were just on will be pre-filled in the form.

4.  **Analyze and Save:** From here, you can use the **"AI Analyze"** button to fetch metadata, add your own notes, and save the item to your knowledge base just as you normally would.
